#### Task 3b: Generate a Grid of Nested Squares Patterns

Expand the existing program that generates nested squares to create a grid of these patterns. The goal is to replicate the design shown in the latest image, where multiple instances of the nested squares pattern are arranged in a grid format.

#### Implementation Requirements

1. **Grid Drawing**:

   - Use the existing `<canvas>` element to draw multiple nested squares patterns in a grid layout.
   - Define the number of rows and columns for the grid to determine how many patterns will be drawn.

2. **JavaScript Logic Update**:

   - Modify the existing JavaScript function to repeat the nested squares drawing process for each cell in the grid.
   - Calculate the starting coordinates for each pattern based on the grid's row and column.

3. **Dynamic Controls**:
   - Extend the user interface to allow input for the number of rows and columns in the grid.
   - Allow the user to dynamically adjust the grid dimensions, the number of squares per pattern, and the rotation angle for each nested square.
